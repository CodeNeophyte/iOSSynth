# iOSSynth

This project is an iOS version of the Synth plug-in tutorial that [The Audio Programmer](https://twitter.com/audioprogrammer) did on his Youtube Channel.
* This is part 1 of the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxKEFTQRZPI

The project is built using the [JUCE framework](https://juce.com) and the [Maximilian library](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian).
